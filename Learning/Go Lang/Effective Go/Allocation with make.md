### Allocation with make`

Back to allocation. The built-in function `make(T,` _args_`)` serves a purpose different from `new(T)`. It creates slices, maps, and channels only, and it returns an _initialized_ (not _zeroed_) value of type `T` (not `*T`). The reason for the distinction is that these three types represent, under the covers, references to data structures that must be initialized before use. A slice, for example, is a three-item descriptor containing a pointer to the data (inside an array), the length, and the capacity, and until those items are initialized, the slice is `nil`. For slices, maps, and channels, `make` initializes the internal data structure and prepares the value for use. For instance,

make([]int, 10, 100)

allocates an array of 100 ints and then creates a slice structure with length 10 and a capacity of 100 pointing at the first 10 elements of the array. (When making a slice, the capacity can be omitted; see the section on slices for more information.) In contrast, `new([]int)` returns a pointer to a newly allocated, zeroed slice structure, that is, a pointer to a `nil` slice value.

These examples illustrate the difference between `new` and `make`.

var p *[]int = new([]int)       // allocates slice structure; *p == nil; rarely useful
var v  []int = make([]int, 100) // the slice v now refers to a new array of 100 ints

// Unnecessarily complex:
var p *[]int = new([]int)
*p = make([]int, 100, 100)

// Idiomatic:
v := make([]int, 100)

Remember that `make` applies only to maps, slices and channels and does not return a pointer. To obtain an explicit pointer allocate with `new` or take the address of a variable explicitly.
