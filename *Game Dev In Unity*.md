"Game Ideas"
1. Idle Clicker game 
*Make an engine like system with all prefabs and a shop*

*Add a Game Engine system where the game logic will be calculated and used*

*Add different updates to the shop as well as make it work as a button opening a new canvas*

2. Merge Game
*Need more investigation as well as projects samples to look at and decide a theme for which the game will be used + Think of how to implement the earn method*

*Get theme or use Leonardo AI to make anime girls and merge them for unlocking stories as well as their looks*

3. 3D Driver Game
*Make similar to Paco chaser, where you spawn in a city and need to avoid houses but collect coins to unlock other vehicles, some sprites are in the unity asset store worth 5$*

*Learn how to implement AI police drivers which chase and crash into the player ending the game*

*Think of a store and some updates which the car can have, such as live or endurance*

*Look into similar games and try finding some sample material for the game which you can use*

4. 3D Open World Game about a Death Reaper
*Main Weapon is a Death Scythe which can be updated with some materials to deal some effects and increased damage*

*Make the plater in 3D and give it an ability to craft or unlock wings after some specific action has been done*

*Enemies need to look up some sprites and AI so that they attack the player + their animations*

*Game is to be open world but with the start in a house or some building where the MC gains the powers of a death reaper*
